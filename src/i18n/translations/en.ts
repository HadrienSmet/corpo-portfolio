I handled offline functionality, UI updates, email displays, and application versioning, always striving for clean, maintainable, and scalable code.",
                    2: "Beyond front-end, I expanded my expertise into the back-end, working extensively with AWS services to develop data processing pipelines, database interactions (DynamoDB), and system integrations. I implemented batch processing, encryption strategies, and cloud infrastructure improvements, showcasing my ability to bridge the gap between front-end and back-end technologies.",
                    3: "I thrive in collaborative environments, enjoy tackling complex technical challenges, and am passionate about delivering high-quality user interfaces that enhance engagement and performance.",
